# Ansible Role: PHP

Forked role from Geerlingguy Ansible Role PHP (https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-php). It's only compatible with Debian (Maybe Ubuntu, but not tested.)

This role installs PHP 7.1 from the sury.org package repo and configure it to work with latest MySQL, Redis (with phpredis and session.save_handler) and nginx as webserver
